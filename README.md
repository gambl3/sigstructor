# sigstructor
Bash script for creating snort and suricata rules in Security Onion.
This script is very beta; still writing in many functions and will eventually add input validation.
Currently uses Zenity to prompt for basic IDS rule variables then places the rule in the appropriate location, tests and restarts the service. More to follow.
